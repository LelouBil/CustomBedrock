# CustomBedrock

### Introduction

This software runs the offical minecraft bedrock server in the background and intercepts packets coming into it using the code of [ProxyPass](https://github.com/NukkitX/ProxyPass/)

### Usage

Right now I made a few build-in commands but the plan would be to separete them in a different repo and to make a plugin format

To use it you need to create a server directory next to the jar file and place the official bedrock server in it. (bedrock_server)
